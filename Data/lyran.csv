But you were too polite to leave me Do you miss the rogue Who coaxed you into paradise and left you there? Will you forgive my soul When youre too wise to trust me and too old to care? Cause we were like the mall before the internet It was the one place to be The mischief the giftwrapped suburban dreams Sorry for not winning you an arcade ring Over and over Lost again with no surprises Disappointments close your eyes And it gets colder and colder When the sun goes down Were you waiting at our old spot In the tree line by the gold clock? Did I leave you hanging every single day? Were you standing in the hallway with a big cake? Happy birthday Did I paint your bluest skies the darkest gray? A universe away And when I got into the accident The sight that flashed before me was your face But when I walked up to the podium I think that I forgot to say your name Im on a bench in Coney Island Wondering where did my baby go?

He Lied About Death,Stars,rebellion,"What gives you the right? To fuck with our lives?

Heart Shaped Locket,Shallow Alcove,reminiscing,Im alone for the week so Ill go for a walk Past community libraries and people with gardens Planting roots and pulling up their weeds Feeling tied the past water towers on hills Sneaking up to the top when we had time to kill We always wondered if Carole still loves Bill Carry all my old friends In a heartshaped locket Keep em tied around my neck Even though they hold me back and Im blowing kisses Driving down dead ends Keep your photo on the fridge Knowing I wont talk to you again Counting minutes and hours till Im fully obsessed Never have enough time for my scarcity complex Every moment feels gone before it leaves me Purple houses no ones home Fancy parties empty hosts Walking home in the pouring rain Cowboy boots made me miss my train Carry all my old friends In a heartshaped locket Keep em tied around my neck Even though they hold me back and Im blowing kisses Like Im not haunted Every moment that I miss Even ones I wish I could forget Carry all my old friends In a heartshaped locket Keep em tied around my neck Even though they hold me back and Tying up my loose ends Into perfect ribbons Growing older is a gift Letting go is just a part of it The hard part is that time it passes The best part is that time it passes The hard part is it never lasts But the best part is just that you had it The hard part is it never lasts But the best part is just that you had it

She's such an angel But then again, kinda wish she were dead as she Walks by What a sight for sore eyes Brighter than the blue sky She's got you mesmerized while I die Why would you ever kiss me? I'm not even half as pretty You gave her your sweater, it's just polyester But you like her better I wish I were Heather I wish I were Heather (Oh, oh) Wish I were Heather Why would you ever kiss me?

Holy,PVRIS,religion,"Yeah, you've got it all, But you've got it all wrong. No, you don't know You're a poor unfortunate soul. Oh I know, You make it seem that you feel whole, So they don't know You're a poor unfortunate soul. Yeah you put on a faith facade, Think you're holy when you're not. I hate to break it to you baby, But you're simply lost. You can right all the wrongs just to feel you belong, But simply calling out sins don't bring you closer to God. You're just a ghost at most, A set of empty bones, Searching for anything and everything to make you feel whole, When it gets cold, oh oh oh. You don't know. No you don't know. Oh you're all alone, You poor unfortunate soul. You can't control where your body lets you go. Oh you're all alone, You poor unfortunate soul. And you say that I've got it all wrong. 'Cause you just know I'm a poor unfortunate soul. But there's no way that there's weight in the words that you preach, When you're claiming your faith and you contradict your speech. So I sit here and listen to your tongue and cheek, I know that when you sit and pray you're only praying for keeps. Cause you're a ghost at most, A set of empty bones, Searching for anything and everything to make you feel whole, When it gets cold, oh oh oh. You don't know. No you don't know. Oh you're all alone, You poor unfortunate soul. You can't control where your body lets you go. Oh you're all alone, You poor unfortunate soul. You're shallow and empty and filled with regret. I think that chest must be heavy from that cross on your neck You only wear 'cause you're wary of what comes next after your death. Don't think I didn't notice. Don't think I didn't notice. Don't think I didn't know you're just a po-oh-oh-oh Poor unfortunate so-o-o-oul Poor unfortunate so-o-o-oul Poor unfortunate so-o-o-oul Poor unfortunate And you've got it all (poor unfortunate so-o-o-oul) You've got it all wrong (poor unfortunate so-o-o-oul) No you'll never know, never know, never know (poor unfortunate so-o-o-oul) You're a poor unfortunate soul.

How To Never Stop Being Sad,dandelion hands,mental health,Time has proven that fooling yourself into believing a lie Is the most effective way to deal with things You have no control over Keep listening to the mixtapes they made you Overanalyze every single word you hear Was this a sign that things were going wrong? No no you were the one that cared too hard not them Stay up every single night staring at your phone Either attempting to gather up the courage to turn these demons These constant reminders of your loneliness Into nothing more than a bad dream Or praying just for one second You could feel the warmth of equally returned love Go out for coffee four times a week by yourself Always bring your notebook never stop writing Leave little comics and thank you notes with your tip Watch them smile as you get in your car Talk down on yourself whenever possible My life is shit because I deserve it right? You must have done something really bad Its nearly impossible for you to cry now Avoid your friends for weeks even though Theyre the only sense of consistency you have left in your life If they really wanted to see you theyd come but they wont Who cares? Allow yourself to lose interest in the things you love Watch as you begin to take a backseat To the world around you dont fight it Become a secondary character in your own motion picture But most importantly Drown every single one of your feelings in old stolen rum Learn to love the taste of it dripping down your throat Find comfort in the warmth coming from your stomach Youre drinking bottled love now You dont need other people to drive away your loneliness You just needed to find a way to talk to it

Cursing my name wishing I stayed Look at how my tears ricochet And I can go anywhere I want Anywhere I want just not home And you can aim for my heart go for blood But you would still miss me in your bones And I still talk to you when Im screaming at the sky And when you cant sleep at night you hear my stolen lullabies I didnt have it in myself to go with grace And so the battleships will sink beneath the waves You had to kill me but it killed you just the same Cursing my name wishing I stayed You turned into your worst fears And youre tossing out blame drunk on this pain Crossing out the good years And youre cursing my name wishing I stayed Look at how my tears ricochet

Whered The Time Go? Whered The Time Go? Whered The Time Go?

You had me several years ago when I was still quite naive Well you said that we made such a pretty pair and that you would never leave But you gave away the things you loved And one of them was me I had some dreams they were clouds in my coffee, clouds in my coffee and You're so vain You probably think this song is about you You're so vain, you're so vain I bet you think this song is about you Don't you don't you, don't you? I had some dreams they were clouds in my coffee, clouds in my coffee and You're so vain You probably think this song is about you You're so vain (you're so vain) I bet you think this song is about you Don't you don't you Well I hear you went up to Saratoga And your horse naturally won Then you flew your lear jet up to Nova Scotia To see the total eclipse of the sun Well you're where you should be all the time And when you're not, you're with some underworld spy Or the wife of a close friend, wife of a close friend and You're so vain You probably think this song is about you You're so vain (so vain) I bet you think this song is about you Don't you don't you, don't you, don't you now You're so vain You probably think this song is about you You're so vain Probably think this song about you You're so vain"

Your Star,Shallow Alcove,moving on,Told me you wanted to change your hair Never see you really wanna be anywhere Driving down the neighborhood streets Never taking your eyes off me You hold my hand Told me you wanted to change your hair And disappear I dont need you to call And tell me how I probably shouldve felt Though I knew youd fall The end of your world shouldnt be my fault Lowercase never bracing for the fall My heart wore it on my sleeves or on my wall Beaten down but Im not broken Try to speak and nearly choke Im breathing in and out Lowercase you can stay up late but dont fall in love Thatll never be enough I dont need you to call And tell me how I probably shouldve felt Though I knew youd fall The end of your world shouldnt be my fault I hope you find what youre looking for
